# wiki-spiderweb

Wiki Spiderweb is a graphical user interface to the Wikipedia.

The project has been lying dormant in a backup for a long time and I have now decided to resurrect it.

I had to drop a few features because I could not get them to work in the new development environment (mainly the preview)
but on the other hand the new application will be completely free and open-source.

Until the screenshots of the revamped version are available here a few screenshots of the previous releases.
